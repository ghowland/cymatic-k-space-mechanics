  "title": "Unified Field Theory via Discrete Cymatic Substrate: A Two-Parameter Framework Deriving All Physics from Planck Bubble Dynamics",
  "upload_type": "publication",
  "publication_type": "article",
  "description": "We present a unified framework where all physical phenomena emerge from discrete oscillators (Planck bubbles) on a 2D substrate. From two parameters (β_P, R_max), we derive: quantum mechanics, gravity, particles, dark energy, and consciousness. The framework makes five falsifiable predictions, including dark energy evolution (ρ_Λ ∝ 1/t) testable by 2045. This is an alternative physics framework presented for scientific scrutiny and experimental falsification.",

  "notes": "ALTERNATIVE PHYSICS FRAMEWORK - This is a theoretical framework in alternative physics presenting a discrete ontology for spacetime. It reduces 25+ parameters of Standard Model + ΛCDM to 2 substrate constants. Five experimental predictions are provided, three testable with current technology. This work is presented for scientific scrutiny and is intended to be falsifiable through experimental tests.",
